Flutter is Google’s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.</p>\n<p>And <a href=\"https://dart.dev\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Dart</a> is the programming language used to code Flutter apps.</p>\n<p>In the past, I have tried hybrid mobile app frameworks, but they all use WebView under the hood.</p>\n<p>Dart is quite promising, no WebView and all code written gets compiled to native platforms.</p>\n<p>Dart is similar to React Native, but doesn’t need to use a bridge like React Native and is even faster.</p>\n<p>So if you are looking for a single codebase, multiple platforms, Flutter is your framework of choice.</p>","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"title":"Dart","date":"July 04, 2020","spoiler":"So I tried Dart today for the first time","cta":"dart"},"fields":{"slug":"/dart/","langKey":"en"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/dart/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/two-years-into-leadership/","langKey":"en","directoryName":"two-years-into-leadership","maybeAbsoluteLinks":[]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Two year work anniversary"}},"next":null,"translations":[],"translatedLinks":[]}}}
