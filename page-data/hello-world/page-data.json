The CSS is inspired from <a href=\"https://moderncss.dev/\">modernCSS.dev</a>.</p>\n<h2>The <code>this</code> bug</h2>\n<p>There seems to be a bug when you create your first blog post, Gatsby will complain saying <code>error</code>. Luckily I searched on the internet and found a hack. If it is your only post, then you need to add the following into your blog page:</p>\n<p><code>[this](&#x3C;blop-page-name>)</code>. If you look at Github, then this first post has a <code>this</code> keyword with the name of the blog page.</p>\n<p>Have fun with Gatsby!</p>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/hello-world/\">this</a></p>","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"title":"Hello World","date":"March 09, 2020","spoiler":"Setting up a Gatsby Blog","cta":"gatsby"},"fields":{"slug":"/hello-world/","langKey":"en"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/hello-world/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/interview-advice/","langKey":"en","directoryName":"interview-advice","maybeAbsoluteLinks":[]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Interview advice"}},"translations":[],"translatedLinks":[]}}}
