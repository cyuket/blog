One of the research projects was <code>Intelligent Digital Menu for Restaurants</code> which had a graph to show trends based on a recommendation algorithm for the digital restaurant menu. A designer colleague came up to me with a prototype and asked what did I think! It was an interactive bar and line chart.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./encounter.gif\" alt=\"That&#x27;s how I got in\"></p>\n<p>Given my JavaScript background, and back then with a most recent experience of hacking into Yuijs (Yahoo Charts), I said I would make it work! D3 was like jQuery, but most important to me, it was JavaScript!</p>\n<p>The year was 2012, and <code>Big Data</code> was the new hype back then. I was also volunteering for <a href=\"https://www.datakind.org/\">DataKind Bangalore</a> during the weekends. Amidst a bunch of data scientists, I was the data viz diva with my D3 skills!</p>\n<h2>Lightbeam</h2>\n<p>In 2017, I worked on <a href=\"https://princiya777.wordpress.com/category/lightbeam/\">Lightbeam</a> with <a href=\"https://medium.com/read-write-participate/shining-a-light-on-web-tracking-2194cdbdae5c\">Mozilla</a>, a browser extension which shows first and third party web trackers as you browse the internet. The visualisation grows based on your browsing history, and uses an interactive force-directed graph which uses D3's force-directed graph algorithm. The initial work was supported by <a href=\"https://www.outreachy.org/apply/\">Outreachy</a> and later funded by <a href=\"https://prototypefund.de/en/project/lightbeam/\">PrototypeFund.de</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"./lbimport.gif\" alt=\"Lightbeam\"></p>","timeToRead":2,"frontmatter":{"title":"To D3 or not","date":"August 08, 2020","spoiler":"You may not necessarily need D3.js for visualisations","cta":"visualisations"},"fields":{"slug":"/to-d3-or-not/","langKey":"en"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/to-d3-or-not/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/unit-vs-integration-vs-end-to-end-tests/","langKey":"en","directoryName":"unit-vs-integration-vs-end-to-end-tests","maybeAbsoluteLinks":[]},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to know if you are writing integration tests or end to end tests"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/helping-guide-new-tech-lead/","langKey":"en","directoryName":"helping-guide-new-tech-lead","maybeAbsoluteLinks":[]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Helping guide for every new tech lead"}},"translations":[],"translatedLinks":[]}}}
