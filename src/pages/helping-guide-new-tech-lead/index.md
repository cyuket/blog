Quest for tech lead resources

Last week I asked on twitter for communities or groups that female leaders in tech were a part of.

The tweet got some nice attention and some of the suggestions I received were helpful. None of them were women specific, and the next thing I had in my mind was this:

Over the weekend I sat down to map my mind on a paper and help myself get what I want.

## What do I want?

Firstly, I had to be clear to myself on what was I trying to search.

I was in the lookout for communities or groups to discuss problems what tech leaders face, more specifically, what women tech leaders face. When I realised from my above tweet and after a bit of research that there weren't groups or communities to discuss women specific tech leader problems, I wanted to create a virtual space myself so that women could come and share problems, find solutions.

## Why do I want?

As a female leader in tech, sometimes I have my blue days and I was hoping to have a closed group to talk and rant over the day to day things. In the past, ~3 years ago in 2017, when I newly started out in opensource, it was overwhelming too. I contributed to Firefox devtools debugger and then I did Outreachy internship which was a game changer.

Last year, in 2019, I was helping co-organise the bi-weekly open source diversity calls, where people in open source used to gather and discuss how to make the space more diverse and inclusive. Prior to this, I was part of a closed open source maintainer cohort whose attempt was to bring more [diverse maintainers](https://princiya777.wordpress.com/2019/04/07/diverse-maintainers-in-open-source/) into open source.

During my mind-mapping activity I realised I wanted a similar thing about female leaders in tech.

## How do I want?

When I got to the `HOW` part, it made more clear to me about the earlier `WHAT` and the `WHY` topics.
