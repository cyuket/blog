# Hello World

I recently subsribed to [Monica Lent's](https://bloggingfordevs.com/) newsletter to get better with blogging, writing content and mainly learning and getting better with SEO.

As a first step, I am migrating away from my old [Wordpress blog](https://princiya777.wordpress.com) to a self owned one and I choose Gatsby.

In the past, I've tried Jekyll and Hugo static site generators but was not happy when I had to make some small changes and the learning curve there was too high.

I really like Gatsby, given my React experience, and I am finally happy with a static site generator.

So here I am, with a new digital garden of my own.
