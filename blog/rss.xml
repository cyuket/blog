&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.outreachy.org/apply/&quot;&gt;Outreachy&lt;/a&gt; supports diversity in open source &amp;#x26; free software and provides 3 months paid remote internships. Interns are paid an internship stipend of $5,500 USD + $500 USD travel stipend to attend conferences or events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Cannot recommend this program enough. Definitely worth participating.. Thank you &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/outreachy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@outreachy&lt;/a&gt; for the best 3 months &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/yfsBrRJCJi&quot;&gt;https://t.co/yfsBrRJCJi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Princiya üëß‚Äç (@princi_ya) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/princi_ya/status/900247719985524737?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;August 23, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017, I was one of the 39 participants selected for Outreachy&apos;s summer internship. You can read my excitement &lt;a href=&quot;https://princiya777.wordpress.com/2017/05/05/outreachy-suspense-unfolds/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and all the Outreachy blog post series &lt;a href=&quot;https://princiya777.wordpress.com/category/outreachy/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./outreachy-results.png&quot; alt=&quot;My outreachy application was selected in 2017&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, I get a lot of direct messages on Twitter from prospect applicants when a new round of Outreachy has opened and this year I thought I will jot it down as a blogpost so that it can serve many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial applications for Outreachy Dec 2020 to Mar 2021 internships are due on Sep 20 at 4pm UTC!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We&amp;#39;ve made some policy changes this round. If you are a student or impacted by COVID-19, please read our blog post:&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/CEiXtCVhnE&quot;&gt;https://t.co/CEiXtCVhnE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Outreachy Internships (@outreachy) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/outreachy/status/1299378069451415554?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;August 28, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who have reached out to me in the past asking why they weren&apos;t chosen or what they could have done better, then they would also be familiar with my story that I wasn&apos;t chosen in my first attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;It&amp;#39;s exactly one year ago during this time I participated in &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/outreachy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@outreachy&lt;/a&gt; and it was AMAZING! Now I go about telling everyone &amp;#39;highly recommend to take a break and try this!, You will be forever grateful&amp;#39;. DMs open, ping me if anyone needs help. happy to help :)&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Princiya üëß‚Äç (@princi_ya) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/princi_ya/status/963490655765921792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 13, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Not every attempt is successful&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, I had heard about Outreachy for the first time at a local meetup in Bangalore, India. I was keen on contributing to opensource and this internship seemed just about right. The fact that it was a paid internship made it more appealing. With no prior opensource contribution experience, I was excited in applying for this internship. But when the results were announced I wasn&apos;t selected. Here&apos;s why and how I learned from my failed attempt and succeeded the second time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./second-chance.png&quot; alt=&quot;There is always a second chance&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Icons made by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flaticon.com/authors/roundicons&quot; title=&quot;Roundicons&quot;&gt;Roundicons&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flaticon.com/&quot; title=&quot;Flaticon&quot;&gt;www.flaticon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I think I failed because -&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I did not find time to do the preparatory work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had applied almost last minute, and didn&apos;t have enough time to prepare or learn more about the project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I did not pick a project that matched my skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&apos;s ok to apply the last minute, but then it&apos;s better to pick a project where you can make contributions faster&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I applied for the first time in 2015, the application was due in ~3 weeks time. I applied without doing any homework, i.e. I had no idea about the participating organisations or the type of projects involved. Hence, I lost most of the initial time in scouting through the projects list. Also, if you are late to apply, then you will most likely see the following message from some organisations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project already has many applicants applying!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I was late to apply and some of the projects which I was interested in were appealing to others too, I settled with a project which was out of my comfort zone. I applied for &lt;a href=&quot;https://ignitionrobotics.org/home&quot;&gt;Ignition Robotics&lt;/a&gt; which was from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openrobotics.org/&quot;&gt;Open Robotics&lt;/a&gt;. The initial work involved working with C++ and Node.js. Back then, I was not comfortable to ask questions to strangers on the internet and chose to do most of the preparatory work myself and when I had a working prototype I contacted the project&apos;s mentor and emailed them my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/princiya/Ign3DViz&quot;&gt;solution&lt;/a&gt;. I was happy that I did a fair job in attempting to work with C++ and find a solution for D3.js visualisation with Node.js but when the results were announced I was not accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Didn&amp;#39;t get through &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/outreachy?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#outreachy&lt;/a&gt; this time :-( Trying for March :-) renewed energy and enthusiasm. @OSRFoundation &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/d3?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#d3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Princiya üëß‚Äç (@princi_ya) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/princi_ya/status/666765603936407552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 17, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;FAQs and tips for acing your application&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the chances of getting into the internship?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to ensure my application is selected?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This depends with an individual and their application itself, it&apos;s like clearing an interview and securing your job.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is always good to do some homework and have an idea about the participating organisations and their projects so that it will save you time from choosing the right project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outreachy&apos;s initial round has 6 weeks for you to apply where you are expected to make some initial contributions to the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every project and it&apos;s mentors are different.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making many contributions to one project usually helps the mentors to assess your skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can also pick 2,3 projects based on your interests and skills, and always contribute to more than one project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I prefer the former approach; making multiple contributions to one project. When there are too many applicants for one specific project of your interest, then the latter approach helps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;TIP 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start talking to mentors early.&lt;/strong&gt; Each project will have many applicants, so it&apos;s better you let the project&apos;s mentor know that you are interested too. Discuss how you plan to apply, ask questions while making the initial contributions, or propose some enhancements to the initial expected contribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be specific with your question to the mentor. Do respect their time, becuase they would be receiving queries from many applicants. Following is a bad example because it shows a lazy behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Hey, I am interested to apply, can you please help me&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following is a good example because it shows you have researched about the project and are genuinely interested in contributing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Hi, I learned about your project and keen to apply for Outreachy internship. However, when trying to clone the repository and running the initial command, I did not manage to setup my local environment. I am running on &amp;#x3C;EXAMPLE OS&gt;, &amp;#x3C;EXAMPLE BROWSER&gt; etc. Could you please help me out? I also tried to search on the internet for the said issue, and found this &amp;#x3C;LINK&gt; but it did not help.&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if you&apos;re a beginner and really finding it difficult to find a simple project to contribute to?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is Outreachy beginner friendly?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I select a project?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selecting a project itself will depend on your interests + skills. As I mentioned earlier, it also helps to do the homework in advance so that you can save time in choosing the right project when the applications are due. In terms of the nature of the projects, not all of them involve coding. &lt;strong&gt;There are documentation related projects too!&lt;/strong&gt; For projects involving coding work, a general experience with working in open source, remote teams is nice to have along with a baic knowledge of &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;TIP 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new round of applications are now open and if you are overwhelmed by the no. of participating organisations or projects, then you can use this time to learn and understand the process and be well prepared when the next round of applications are due again in 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is mentioned that we need to contribute to some open source project during the six week application period. I am new to open source, how to find projects to contribute to?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is your first-time contributing to opensource, I can totally relate to the feeling of being overwhelmed. When I applied for Outreachy the second time in 2017, it took me ~3 months to learn about a project and take the courage to submit my first PR in February 2017. When the internship applications were due in March, I was much more confident than the initial attempt from 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Thanks &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/princi_ya?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@princi_ya&lt;/a&gt; for flexing &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FirefoxDevTools?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@FirefoxDevTools&lt;/a&gt; Debugger&amp;#39;s tabs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They absolutely flow 100% better!&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/DEDoPjzwOZ&quot;&gt;https://t.co/DEDoPjzwOZ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/Ua3qZyimbv&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/Ua3qZyimbv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Jason Laster (@jasonlaster11) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jasonlaster11/status/831284106029707266?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 13, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;TIP 3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find an opensource project to contribute to well in advance so that you get a feel of what it is like to work in the open!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;During the initial stage of the appplication, how do you answer the question related to discrimination because I havent faced any yet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it necessary to write something big in the essay type questions of the application which asks you to describe how you were underrepresented in technology sector? I only see economic factor for me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the initial application I wrote one to two lines for the essay questions, maybe that&apos;s why I got rejected?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be specific to the point while filling out your application. Don&apos;t write big stories if you have nothing to explain. Be legit, that&apos;s the most important part. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;TIP 4&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highlight your work, ideas, and write more details why should you be considered. Demonstrate volunteering experience (if any) related to opensource or coding, lessons learned from attending a specific meetup or reading someone&apos;s technical blog post. Share something that you deeply care about and is relevant to the project!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/princiya/log-network-requests&quot;&gt;My initial contribution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;General advice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;You shouldn&amp;#39;t self-select out of Outreachy because you&amp;#39;re nervous about your current skillset. Instead, pick a project and try to contribute to it. Ask for help when you get stuck. Worst case scenario, you learn new skills! üçÄ&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Outreachy Internships (@outreachy) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/outreachy/status/964336066705551360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 16, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age is never a barrier&lt;/strong&gt;. It&apos;s never late to start your first open source contribution. When I applied, I did have ~6 years of software engineering experience but never contributed to open source. So Outreachy does accept diverse backgrounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask yourself why do you need this internship&lt;/strong&gt;. Be clear to yourself and how this internship will align with your personal goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find out peers and mentors on social media&lt;/strong&gt;. You can find lot of Outreachy alumni like me on Twitter and reach out to them about their past experiences üòä. Please respect their time and keep the communication respectful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can DM me on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/princi_ya&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and I would be happy to review your applications. I wish you all the best!&lt;/p&gt;

Are you trying to find tech lead resources?]]></description><link>http://princiya.com/blog/helping-guide-new-tech-lead/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://princiya.com/blog/helping-guide-new-tech-lead/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 23 Aug 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Quest for tech lead resources&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week I asked on twitter for communities or groups that female leaders in tech were a part of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Where do female leaders in tech hang out? Specifically looking for groups / communities to talk, discuss about engineering problems, scaling teams, hiring + firing, career growth options for tech leads etc.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Princiya üëß‚Äç (@princi_ya) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/princi_ya/status/1294960996113698817?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;August 16, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tweet got some nice attention and some of the suggestions I received were helpful. None of them were women specific, and the next thing I had in my mind was this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Would you be interested in a virtual Q&amp;amp;A to discuss engineering problems, scaling teams, hiring + firing, career growth options for tech leads, problems specific to women leaders etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;RT for reach üôè&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Princiya üëß‚Äç (@princi_ya) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/princi_ya/status/1296374565963276288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;August 20, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend I sat down to map my mind on a paper and help myself get what I want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What do I want?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I had to be clear to myself on what was I trying to search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in the lookout for communities or groups to discuss problems what tech leaders face, more specifically, what women tech leaders face. When I realised from my above tweet and after a bit of research that there weren&apos;t groups or communities to discuss women specific tech leader problems, I wanted to create a virtual space myself so that women could come and share problems, find solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why do I want?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a female leader in tech, sometimes I have my blue days and I was hoping to have a closed group to talk and rant over the day to day things. In the past, ~3 years ago in 2017, when I newly started out in opensource, it was overwhelming too. I contributed to Firefox devtools debugger and then I did Outreachy internship which was a game changer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, in 2019, I was helping co-organise the bi-weekly open source diversity calls, where people in open source used to gather and discuss how to make the space more diverse and inclusive. Prior to this, I was part of a closed open source maintainer cohort whose attempt was to bring more &lt;a href=&quot;https://princiya777.wordpress.com/2019/04/07/diverse-maintainers-in-open-source/&quot;&gt;diverse maintainers&lt;/a&gt; into open source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my mind-mapping activity I realised I wanted a similar thing about female leaders in tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How do I want?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got to the &lt;code&gt;HOW&lt;/code&gt; part, it made more clear to me about the earlier &lt;code&gt;WHAT&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;WHY&lt;/code&gt; topics. I started analysing similar activities from the technical and non-technical space. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monica Lent&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://bloggingfordevs.com/blog/&quot;&gt;blogging for devs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entertainment shows which I love to binge watch; for example: The Kapil Sharma Show&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapil_Sharma_(comedian)&quot;&gt;Kapil Sharma&lt;/a&gt; is an Indian standup comedian who is known for his witty jokes and excellent comedy timings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are other examples too, but for now, let&apos;s stick to these two&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One thing that is common here is that both of them know their domain pretty well and are able to generate content and keep the audience engaged&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I started to ask myself how do I want to create a closed space or answer in detail the &lt;code&gt;WHAT&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;WHY&lt;/code&gt; topics, it made sense to learn the subject matter and get better so that at some point (say in one year from now) I could lead the discussions myself or produce more content around these topics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What have I found so far?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have joined the below slack groups, and I am reading lots of articles by scouting through their old messages. I try to read ~3 articles per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./slide1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Slide 1&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My first encounter with D3.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was working at a research lab &lt;a href=&quot;http://aiaioo.com/&quot;&gt;Aiaioo Labs&lt;/a&gt; doing work on artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP). One of the research projects was &lt;code&gt;Intelligent Digital Menu for Restaurants&lt;/code&gt; which had a graph to show trends based on a recommendation algorithm for the digital restaurant menu. A designer colleague came up to me with a prototype and asked what did I think! It was an interactive bar and line chart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./encounter.gif&quot; alt=&quot;That&amp;#x27;s how I got in&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given my JavaScript background, and back then with a most recent experience of hacking into Yuijs (Yahoo Charts), I said I would make it work! D3 was like jQuery, but most important to me, it was JavaScript!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year was 2012, and &lt;code&gt;Big Data&lt;/code&gt; was the new hype back then. I was also volunteering for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.datakind.org/&quot;&gt;DataKind Bangalore&lt;/a&gt; during the weekends. Amidst a bunch of data scientists, I was the data viz diva with my D3 skills!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lightbeam&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, I worked on &lt;a href=&quot;https://princiya777.wordpress.com/category/lightbeam/&quot;&gt;Lightbeam&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/read-write-participate/shining-a-light-on-web-tracking-2194cdbdae5c&quot;&gt;Mozilla&lt;/a&gt;, a browser extension which shows first and third party web trackers as you browse the internet. The visualisation grows based on your browsing history, and uses an interactive force-directed graph which uses D3&apos;s force-directed graph algorithm. The initial work was supported by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.outreachy.org/apply/&quot;&gt;Outreachy&lt;/a&gt; and later funded by &lt;a href=&quot;https://prototypefund.de/en/project/lightbeam/&quot;&gt;PrototypeFund.de&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unit tests&lt;/strong&gt;: Unit tests are atomic. They are within the scope of one component or action or reducer or saga and do not go beyond the scope of this atomic component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example: Unit tests do not involve &lt;code&gt;reducer &amp;#x26;&amp;#x26; saga&lt;/code&gt; being tested together or &lt;code&gt;component &amp;#x26;&amp;#x26; action &amp;#x26;&amp;#x26; reducer &amp;#x26;&amp;#x26; saga&lt;/code&gt; being tested together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrationg tests&lt;/strong&gt;: Integration tests are an extension of unit tests and involve integrating multiple components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example: component click on button -&gt; throws an action -&gt; watched by the saga -&gt; calls an api endpoint (mocked) -&gt; modify reducers state -&gt; changes something on the same or another component.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End to end tests&lt;/strong&gt;: We use Cypress for end to end testing where we test the end results like how an external user with interact with our system / UI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It became evident to the Frontend team that &lt;a href=&quot;https://swagger.io/&quot;&gt;Swagger&lt;/a&gt; documentation alone will not suffice due to the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Properties from the api response get added / removed / updated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no way to inform the stakeholders (FE in our case) about the above change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to these reasons, we want to test an integration point by checking each application (BE or FE) in isolation to ensure the messages it sends or receives conform to a shared understanding that is documented in a &quot;contract&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In simple terms, we want to test the integration point with our BE API client to ensure it sends HTTP response or receives HTTP requests from our web or mobile front-end conforms to a shared understanding that is documented in a &quot;contract&quot;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Terminology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consumer&lt;/strong&gt; --&gt; The one who consumes the information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provider&lt;/strong&gt; --&gt; The one who provids the information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s interesting to note that, contract tests enable testing of applications from either ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt; The backend can be contract tested with a mock frontend and viceversa. Both the backend and frontend can interchange and act as the consumer or the provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contract is generated during the execution of the automated tests. The &lt;strong&gt;consumer generates contract files&lt;/strong&gt; during the execution of its isolated tests. The &lt;strong&gt;provider generates verification results&lt;/strong&gt; during the execution of its isolated tests. These artifacts need to be shared between projects and people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Decision&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will use &lt;a href=&quot;https://pact.io&quot;&gt;Pact&lt;/a&gt; as the contract test framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Consequences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable FE teams to (sometimes) work ahead while the BE API is still being developed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The consumer and provider are both under active development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contract tests execute faster than the integration tests and will tell which versions of our applications can be deployed safely together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can find out before we deploy whether or not our applications will work together, i.e. this version of FE against a given version of BE; and there is no need to wait for slow e2e tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Contract vs Integration tests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first heard the term contract testing only last month mainly when we were trying to figure out how to have better API tests and that the BE changes become more visible to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integration tests or end to end tests (offcourse these two are not same) require the application to be setup, or run beforehand to enable the tests themselves to run. This is the biggest key difference between integration and contract tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example:
Imagine you are planning to buy / rent a house. First you will see the house itself. If it interests you then you will sign the contract. The contract will then detail what is agreed between you and the other person selling / renting the place. This contract will then serve as the basis. If anything needs to change, then you need to update the contract itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replace the house with the application. You are the consumer, the owner of the house is the provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First you will see the house itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will build the application, run unit tests, and test the application locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it interests you then you will sign the contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contract tests are run with what is agreed between the consumer and the provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You didn&apos;t have to move into the house to sign the contract. But the contract was the first agreement before moving into the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s the same with deploying the application itself to production or staging environment. The consumer contract tests can be tested against a mock provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas for the integration tests to be run, the application first needs to be deployed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me know what your thoughts are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would you advice your younger self?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was very good at academics and when I enrolled into the university for my under graduate studies I knew that I would definitely crack the campus recruitment and would be placed in a company with handsome salary. But &lt;code&gt;11 years ago&lt;/code&gt;, in 2009, there was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/2009/01/14/global-recession-2009-oped-cx_nr_0115roubini.html&quot;&gt;global recession&lt;/a&gt; and things didn&apos;t go as planned with me in securing a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still remember that day; the first company which came for campus placement was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tcs.com/&quot;&gt;TCS&lt;/a&gt;. I was shocked to find out that I hadn&apos;t cleared the aptitude test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the first failure in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I used to actively participate in extra curriculars since my school days, I did lose quite a few competitions but that was all in a sportive mood and my life wasn&apos;t hanging around those failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cried profusely that day after the first failed campus placement results. I was hopeful that I would make it to the next company but this kept happening couple more times and I had no clue about what was going wrong. I gave up after a few attempts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt like I needed a break after studying all those years so hard and not being able to find my dream job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That year, I took up a teaching job and for the next two years I worked as a Lecturer in Computer Science at an engineering college. I was happy, some of my colleagues were my best friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alongside teaching I took up some freelance web development work and I realised that I was ready for newer challenges. In 2011, I quit the teaching job and joined as a full time Software Engineer and rest is &lt;a href=&quot;../two-years-into-leadership&quot;&gt;history&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have worked hard all through these years and if there&apos;s any advice I could give my younger self then that is -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everything happens for good&lt;/strong&gt;. You will never realise at that point of time, so instead of being sad when things don&apos;t turn your way try to find the positive side of things and keep working hard. There comes a time when all the hard work will be worth it and you will realise for yourself that &lt;code&gt;everything does happen for good&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following quote from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._P._J._Abdul_Kalam&quot;&gt;Dr. Abdul Kalam&lt;/a&gt; is my all time favorite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dream is not what you get in sleep, Dream is what makes you lose your sleep!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

              </content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Career advice]]></title><description><![CDATA[Lessons from my younger self]]></description><link>http://princiya.com/blog/career-advice/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://princiya.com/blog/career-advice/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jul 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many a times I come across Twitter posts which ask -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would you advice your younger self?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&quot;../okr&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; I described how we created OKRs at Curalie. Apart from filling the below table -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Good&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Bad&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Like&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;xx&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;xx&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dislike&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;xx&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;xx&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also asked my colleagues to think about the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short term goal (6 months from now)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Medium term goal (1 year from now)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long term goal (far vision)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was quite interesting to listen to the answers and this made me wonder how my younger self would have answered to these same questions. In one of my earlier &lt;a href=&quot;../lessons-from-my-younger-self&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; I spoke about how things were for me a decade ago!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I started working full time as a Software Engineer, during the first year I did UI development only. Having freshly graduated from college, jQuery was new to me and we were using it back then. There were few things about jQuery which I could not understand well, it was also because I never really understood JavaScript. At my second job at Aiaioo Labs, is when I met this awesome mentor and I learned from him how to learn coding the right way. Critical thinking is crucial for programmers and he thought me how to think about every line of code written. Code should not be written for the sake of writing, but we need to understand what we expect to achieve and what we want the machines to respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example: I was blindly using &lt;code&gt;position: absolute vs relative&lt;/code&gt; and it took some time to really get a hang of asking why was i using &lt;code&gt;absolute vs relative&lt;/code&gt; positioning, and once I started doing this it became more frequent and more natural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also had to opportunity to do full-stack, understand about BE systems, dev ops, databases, UI design etc. If I can recollect, it is the learning environment which I had which led me learn and grow. Sometimes I had to do photoshop, sometimes Java, or sometimes think about why our nodes were down or running slowly. I was also taking basic lessons on machine learning. I remember signing up &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; number of times to this course on Coursera, but never completed it. I was working at a startup, and lot of people including my parents were asking me to leave this company and join a bigger firm. But I stuck to it mainly because I realised how much I had to learn. As they say,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No risk, no story!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After about ~5 years, I decided I wanted to dig deeper into the frontend universe. The role of full-stack didn&apos;t make much sense to me because I started to think that one can never get really good at full-stack given the growing no. of technologies, languages and frameworks. That&apos;s when I landed a job in Berlin and started working as a full-time frontend engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, when I lead other engineers, I wonder and realised had I not had the opportunity to do full-stack, it would have not been possible for me to understand cross-domain dependencies or quickly build prototypes to evaluate a feature or a project. The advice from my previous post is still relevant -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything happens for good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, during these years I have attended numerous technical interviews, failed at tons and have answered this golden question or taught to myself about what I want to be in the long run. Sometimes I have blindly blabbered that I wanted to be the CTO but not knowing or not having a plan about how to get there. My mentor, during my second job did also a good job in making me realise what I was lacking or what I had to achieve / master to reach the end goal. He always saw me as a good programmer, but sometimes I was lazy and was not pushing myself beyond my comfort zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So coming back to the point about listening to my directs tell me what their short / long term goals were, and thinking what I would have answered, it made me realise that my answers wouldn&apos;t or have not been different. The short term goal was always to get good at one particular thing, for example &lt;code&gt;writing tests&lt;/code&gt;. The long term goal was &lt;code&gt;getting good at everything&lt;/code&gt;. Now comes the tricky part about one cannot be good at everything. One can do everything but can never be good at everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as a leader, I suggest people to chase their dreams. Create a learning curve of yourself, get it verified from my peers or mentors. Find yourself a mentor. Nowadays there is internet and lot of options to find a mentor. Do things out of your comfort zone, try to push yourself hard. Pick one topic where you want to get good at and draw out an effective plan or a strategy to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not be afraid to ask questions and most importantly make sure it makes you happy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For Q3, we are working on launching &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR&quot;&gt;Objectives and key results (OKRs)&lt;/a&gt; for the company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here&apos;s my &lt;a href=&quot;../two-years-into-leadership&quot;&gt;recent article&lt;/a&gt; about what I accomplished at Curalie GmbH.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inspired by the book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whatmatters.com/&quot;&gt;Measure What Matters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/tradecraft-traction/this-chart-can-tell-you-when-its-time-to-leave-your-job-6926e0be9228&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; which describes about what you are good / bad at vs what you like / dislike, I asked my directs to fill in the following table:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Good&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Bad&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Like&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;xx&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;xx&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dislike&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;xx&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;xx&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The term &lt;code&gt;Bad&lt;/code&gt; necessarily doesn&apos;t mean what you are bad at, but it also means what you want to improve on, sometimes you haven&apos;t had the time to do a particular task despite you having liked it etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At first, I did this activity myself and realised how difficult it was to arrive at the columns for &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;dislike &amp;#x26; bad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;dislike &amp;#x26; good&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. The latter was easier than the former.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having realised this, I asked everyone to think deep and reflect on the nature of the work, learning curve, product etc. to be able to figure out the difficult parts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The gist of this table is to ensure that nothing is really there on the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;dislike &amp;#x26; bad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; column.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If something is there then that should be the immediate action item to work on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Consequences&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once this activity was done, the next step was to align this table with the OKRs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The alternate way to look at this table is to look at the &lt;strong&gt;Good&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;Bad&lt;/strong&gt; columns from a company&apos;s perspective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example, if you mentioned something in the &lt;strong&gt;Bad&lt;/strong&gt; column, you could look into this as &lt;code&gt;if this is really bad for the company&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So &lt;strong&gt;Good&lt;/strong&gt; for you, might be &lt;strong&gt;Bad&lt;/strong&gt; for the company or vice versa.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on this, it gets quite easy to create objectives and key results for a quarter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Flutter is Google‚Äôs UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href=&quot;https://dart.dev&quot;&gt;Dart&lt;/a&gt; is the programming language used to code Flutter apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, I have tried hybrid mobile app frameworks, but they all use WebView under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dart is quite promising, no WebView and all code written gets compiled to native platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dart is similar to React Native, but doesn&apos;t need to use a bridge like React Native and is even faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you are looking for a single codebase, multiple platforms, Flutter is your framework of choice.&lt;/p&gt;

It&apos;s been great two years until now, I have enjoyed working here every single day (there have been very few blue days) and I look forward to the upcoming challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 years ago, I was looking for a job change and was very much open to take bigger responsibilities and the Open Source Manager job at Zalando happened. Prior to this, I was working as a Software Engineer at Collabary (by Zalando). Although the job was challenging, I didn&apos;t qualify there to a higher pay grade. And my previous manager said I was going through the Dunning Kruger effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was determined to get a better job, title and offcourse higher pay. 2 years now and I could not have been happier from where I am currently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me about yourself&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Äî&gt; Mention what you want them to hear or know about you; your learnings, accomplishments etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep a list of accomplishments ready&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Important learnings, lessons learned&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learnings relevant to tech stack, general team building&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interviewer always looks for ‚Äî&gt; tech competency, most importantly &lt;strong&gt;learning + team fit&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Äî&gt; longer vision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buzzwords ‚Äî&gt; domain driven design ‚Äî&gt; people will catch you on those terms ‚Äî&gt; BEM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Key learning is not to stress and just tell what you have learned from your work experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watch out for expressions from the other person ‚Äî&gt; if they compliment you on your answers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It‚Äôs totally ok to tell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don‚Äôt know&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have used this but now I cannot recall and I might need to browse on the internet; plus one to ‚Äòif I remember correctly‚Äô&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep questions handy to the interviewer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also ask questions about what their accomplishments were, motivations to the other person&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently subsribed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://bloggingfordevs.com/&quot;&gt;Monica Lent&apos;s&lt;/a&gt; newsletter to get better with blogging, writing content and mainly learning and getting better with SEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a first step, I am migrating away from my old &lt;a href=&quot;https://princiya777.wordpress.com&quot;&gt;Wordpress blog&lt;/a&gt; to a self owned one and I choose Gatsby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, I&apos;ve tried Jekyll and Hugo static site generators but was not happy when I had to make some small changes and the learning curve there was too high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like Gatsby, given my React experience, and I am finally happy with a static site generator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here I am, with a new digital garden of my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blog theme is based from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gaearon/overreacted.io&quot;&gt;Dan Abramov&apos;s&lt;/a&gt; personal &lt;a href=&quot;https://overreacted.io/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; with small tweaks. The CSS is inspired from &lt;a href=&quot;https://moderncss.dev/&quot;&gt;modernCSS.dev&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; bug&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There seems to be a bug when you create your first blog post, Gatsby will complain saying &lt;code&gt;error&lt;/code&gt;. Luckily I searched on the internet and found a hack. If it is your only post, then you need to add the following into your blog page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[this](&amp;#x3C;blop-page-name&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;. If you look at Github, then this first post has a &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; keyword with the name of the blog page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have fun with Gatsby!&lt;/p&gt;
